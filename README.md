# national corona map for germany 

Motivation for my project were missing maps, reporting about current corona situation in Germany per federal state. 

I wanted to develop one for myself first (and try out the CSS framework Bulma), then my family and friends got the link, and then it went viral - a small side project turned into an interesting web application, with over 50,000 users and 170,000 views in three months ðŸ¤¯.
